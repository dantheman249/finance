# Repo Overview as of 07/25/2020:

Short Term Goal: Produce a spreadsheet with valuations of the sp500 and expected IRR forecasts so we can buy "cheap" stocks (growth or earnings)

Long Term Goal: Build a tool to help people invest more effectively (based on intrinsic value) and to increase confidence in long-term, buy-and-hold strategies. 

Main file is "current_main" which parses and compiles text files from SEC website by quarter to generate ticker level dataset.
